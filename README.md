# Multicolour

### This is still in development, all hands welcome.

The overall mission of this library is to make mundane CRUD API generation fast, easy and cost efficient by simplifying the work involved in creating RESTful services.

You configure Multicolour and start writing models in the form of JSON and it handles the leg work for you.

We _**love**_ open source software and Multicolour is built atop [Waterline][waterline], [Hapi JS][hapi] and has full OAuth support via [Bell][bell] (we're going to add JWT support soon). It's also self documenting (yeah, really) using [Swagger][swagger].

You can also write middleware to add your business logic easily.

`npm i -G multicolour`

More coming soon.
