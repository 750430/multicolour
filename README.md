The overall mission of this library is to make mundane CRUD API generation fast with a single page app frontend, easy and cost efficient by simplifying the work involved in creating RESTful services and REST based apps.

You configure Multicolour and start writing models in the form of JSON and it handles the leg work for you.

We _**love**_ open source software and Multicolour is built atop [Waterline][waterline], [Hapi JS][hapi] and has [JWT][jwt] support (we're adding OAuth support now). It's also self documenting (yeah, really) using [Swagger][swagger].

Start by running `npm i -G multicolour` then you can start your API development with `multicolour init`, in your desired working folder to get started developing.
